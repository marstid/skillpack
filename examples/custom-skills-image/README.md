# Example: Custom skills image

This directory is the runnable counterpart of the **"Use case: Custom skills
image via your own skills repo"** section in the [top-level README](../../README.md).
It shows how to build a custom skillpack container image that serves *your*
skills and commands instead of — or alongside — the embedded example ones.

## Contents

│       └── COMMAND.md
└── README.md           # this file
```

The sample skills (`logs-triage`, `metrics-query`) and command
(`incident-report`) are intentionally small but follow the agentskills.io
format with all frontmatter fields exercised.

## Build the image locally

From this directory:

```sh
podman build -t skillpack-custom .
```

This pulls the published `ghcr.io/marstid/skillpack:latest` base image, copies
the local `skills/` and `commands/` trees in (replacing the embedded example
skills), and defaults the container to serve them over HTTP.

## Run it

```sh
# HTTP
podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 skillpack-custom

# stdio (for Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
podman run --rm -i skillpack-custom --transport stdio
```

Then connect an MCP client to `http://localhost:8080/mcp` — see the top-level
README for client configuration snippets.

## Wire CI in your own skills repo

1. Create a new git repo for your skills (or copy this directory into an
   existing repo's root).
2. Move `workflow.yaml` to `.github/workflows/build-and-push.yaml`.
3. Replace `yourorg` with your GitHub owner name in the workflow and (if you
   want to rename the image) update `IMAGE:` accordingly.
4. Push to `main`. On every PR merge, CI rebuilds and pushes a new
   `:latest` plus an immutable `:sha-<commit>` tag to your ghcr.io namespace.

## Merge instead of replace

The Dockerfile here uses `--skills-dir` / `--commands-dir` which **fully
replaces** the embedded trees. If you want the embedded example skills
(`markdown-lint`, the `commit` command) to remain available alongside your
own, switch the `CMD` in the Dockerfile to:

```dockerfile
CMD ["--skills-dir", "/skills", "--commands-dir", "/commands", "--merge-skills", "--merge-commands", "--transport", "http", "--addr", ":8080", "--log-level", "info"]
```

User-supplied entries shadow any embedded name collisions (walked last →
last wins). See the top-level README for the full merge-vs-replace reference.
